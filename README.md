## Companies I've worked.

<a name="coren"></a>
### COREN Elektrik (2010 - 10 months)
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/coren-elektrik-enerjisi-ithalat-ihracat-ve-toptan-satis-as/about/">COREN Electricity</a> is a company which is selling electricty to consumers. 
I was 17 years old when the company was launched. 
It was my first business experience. 
I developed a web based software to solve company requirements.
I also designed UI and configured web server.
I didn't use any php framework. Smarty, ezSQL, mysql, jquery were the keys of project.
They used the software for a long time after I left the company.       

<a name="janberk"></a>
Janberk Sahin managed me at COREN. Here is the recommendations from linkedin.

> We worked with Emre Can in Coren Enerji to create the software needed to run the business: invoicing, accounting, customer management, data manipuilation, forecasting, etc. He determined and developed all the data relations and wrote all the code himself and in the end, produced a working business application, which he called MOSS. Despite his young age, he is very knowledgeable and experienced and he is definitely very talented in his area. I simply respect and admire his genius, his capability of learning and his personality.

<a name="gen3"></a>
### Gen3 Creative (2011 - 9 months)
<a href="http://gen3.com.tr/">Gen3</a> is a creative agency.
They are creating really impressive designs.
I started to work at Gen3 to improve my UI skills.
I worked as Full Stack Developer. 
Each project was given to only one developer. 
So, there was no team work. 
Most of projects only had CRUD functions. 
I used php CMS frameworks, shop scripts etc.
 
<a name="atamedya"></a>
### Atamedya (2012 - 7 months)
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ata-yayıncılık-ve-bilişim-teknolojileri-ltd.-şti./about/">Atamedya</a> is a company which provides services to thousands of clients like SEO, Hosting, web based applications, corporate webpages, e-commerce solutions etc.

When I joined the company, they were using old ASP software to manage all customers.
I developed the new one in 5 months.
Just like COREN, all employees used it to manage works. 
There were a lot of features like assigning tasks to design and development teams, managing time plans, managing hosting (edit virtualhosts, create database, ftp credentials etc.), creating offers, customer payments, call center features. 

In Atamedya, I also integrated their e-commerce software to most populer finance applications without a public API and documentation. 
Editing application files programmatically and executing sql queries on MSSQL with FreeTDS was the solution.       
<a name="great"></a>
### great. (2012 - 3 years 4 months)
<a href="http://great.agency/">great.</a> is a digital agency in Istanbul.
I was the first developer on team because it was a start-up company and there were only two members on team.

I created a development team with 4 of my friends.
We developed social media tools, micro pages, social media contests, games, kiosks, magento shops and mobile applications.
<a name="turac"></a> 
Mehmet Turac, gave me a recommendation on linkedin about this position
> Emre is a worker that has a unique behavior to follow, recommend and use nearly all of new technologies you can hear something about. Emre did not let me down a single time. Emre is an energetic, loyal, customer-service oriented and smart php developer. That's him - multi-skilled, intelligent, careful and achievement oriented person. Ambitious team player. It's amazing to work with such a person. If you ever need someone to deliver under pressure, no slip-ups, just results.
 <a name="pharos"></a>
### pharos (2015 - 1 year 3 months)
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pharos-consulting-group/about/">pharos</a> is a digital marketing agency.
I was there as a 6th member of development team as a PHP Developer.
After I joined the company, some bad things happened in Turkey and other members left the country. 
So, I stayed in and managed the crisis alone with automated scripts. 
That is how I got the weird title "Digital Hero". 

I moved dedicated servers to cloud hosts to manage it easy.

I did some bot scripts on web based tools that company used to automate daily jobs.

I've created GitLab server.

I wrote over ongoing native mobile application projects with cordova and angularjs to catch deadlines.

I also developed a tool for making interactive posts on facebook like polls, counters, slides, forms at late 2016.

I made an API bridge for the SOAP services that our clients have.
So we were able to monitor everything, automate reports, extra validations, manage API users etc.

I outsourced ongoing unity projects but deployed myself.
<a name="freelance"></a>
### Freelance (from 2016 January till now)

In my career I managed too much things but I realized I still don't know some basic engineering things like OOP, TDD
So I decided to improve my technical knowledge and I started working as a freelancer. There are more projects than these that I mentioned below. 
<a name="native-ios"></a>
#### Native iOS Application
First project was a native iOS app. I used OpenCV to scan faces from camera.
<a name="dashboard"></a>
#### Symfony Dashboard Application
I developed a dashboard for an ad network exchange company in Netherland. 
I integrated it to Google Ad Manager (known as DoubleClick for Publishers).
So, publishers can see their graphs, manage payments etc.
It also accepts more than 10 different report templates to import data.
It is an ongoing project. I'm working on it since 2017 March.
It also has JWT authentication, mobile app also uses same endpoints with web application.
<a name="gamification"></a>
#### Loyalty, Gamification 
I started to develop a loyalty club for a supermarket chain in 2016.
It is linked with Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, YouTube Live, SurveyMonkey and more than that.
Users can complete tasks with social media accounts, 
like sharing story on instagram, being active on live youtube streams, sharing posts on facebook. 
Users earning points through completing tasks and they can spend these points on supermarket with their Club Card.
It also has game mechanism such as badges, levels and teams. 
I'm working with a MySQL developer to optimize queries.
And we are taking penetration test from different cyber security teams every 6 months.
Except that, I'm managing all the things even servers.
I'm still working on this project.
<a name="cordova"></a>
#### Android app with cordova
I made an android app for fast food chain. It is integrated with Turkish Airlines and Pegasus.
They are using it on the cash desk. It can scan passengers tickets. If there is a delay, they can use discounts.
Also integrated with movie theaters, GSM operators etc. I still work with them when they have an issue.
<a name="linka"></a>
#### Mobile app with Cordova, Java, Swift, Objective C
I made a cordova app for a start-up in Germany and integrated it with <a href="https://www.linkalock.com/">a bluetooth device</a>. 
I developed the cordova plugin (bridge code that I needs to use native SDK) for both of Android and iOS.
It was never published, the company was sold before it could go live.
<a name="react-native-app"></a>
#### React Native app 
I made an application with React Native at late 2017. 
Users can analyze their Instagram and Twitter accounts with it.
It has more than 1 million users now.
Currently I'm working for a new version for this app.
<a name="time-tracker"></a>
#### Time Tracker application
I used <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> to track my time sheets and manage my finance for a long time.
And I realized I'm spending too much money for it and there are lot of bugs they can't fix. 
I launched to <a href="https://github.com/iLevye/time-is-revenue">my own time tracking</a> tool in a night.
Currently only me and a few friends are using it. I want to make it an open source product.
